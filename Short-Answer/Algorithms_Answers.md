#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n), one loop that does N things


b) O(n^2), two loop that do N things


c) O(n), being called N times until base case

## Exercise II

O(n log n), you should use binary sort.  

Since floors are already presort (assuming this doesnt occur in dreamWorld, DragonWarrior etc),
 then we can start at the middle. if the egg breaks, go down half the floors between ground floor
  and current.  If it doesnt, go up halfway between n and current. repeat until you find f.

(fun fact: the eggs wont gain enough force to seriously injure someone for thousands and thousands of floors!
So feel free to aim a few at your boss/awesome instructors/TLs/etc :D )
